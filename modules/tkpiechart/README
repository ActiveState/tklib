Some people have asked for a Tcl/Tk pie utility: so here is my little
implementation with Tcl, not as an extension.

This is version 5.2. It was tested with Tcl8.0/Tk8.0, Tcl8.1/Tk8.1 and
the netscape plug-in 2.0, on both Linux and Windows platforms (it
should work on all Tcl/Tk supported platforms).

It is object oriented using the stooop (Simple Tcl Only Object
Oriented Programming) extension (version 3.6 or above, tcl file
included).

If you have netscape with the Tcl plug-in installed, just Open File...
demo.tcl and voila!

Run the demo script to see what it looks like, read the man pages to
understand how to use it.

Whether you like it (or hate it), please let me know. I would like to
hear about bugs and improvements you would like to see. I will correct
the bugs quickly, especially if you send me a test script.

If you find a bug in the Tcl code and correct it yourself, please
email the modified code so I can include it in the next release. The
same goes for improvements.
