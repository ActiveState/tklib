Some people have asked for a Tcl/Tk pie utility: so here is my little
implementation with Tcl, not as an extension.

This is version 2.1. It was tested with both Tcl7.4/Tk4.0 and
Tcl7.5/Tk4.1 (yes, it even works on Windows! I have not tried the Mac
yet).

It is object oriented using the stooop (Simple Tcl Only Object
Oriented Programming) extension (version 2.2.1, see STOOOP readme).

Run the demo script to see what it looks like, read the pie man page
to understand how to use it.

Whether you like it (or hate it), please let me know. I would like to
hear about bugs and improvements you would like to see. I will correct
the bugs quickly, especially if you send me a test script.

If you find a bug in the Tcl code and correct it yourself, please
email the modified code so I can include it in the next release. The
same goes for improvements.

Note: there is a piecrunch.tcl file that is a stripped version of all
the Tcl files needed for using pies: just source it (thanks to Laurent
Demailly for his tcl_cruncher utility).
