Some people have asked for a Tcl/Tk pie utility: so here is my little
implementation with Tcl, not as an extension.

It should work with Tcl7.4/Tk4.0 and above.

It is object oriented in a way, using pure Tcl code (read the OOTCL file for
more details). Also look at the oop manual page.

Run the demo.tcl script to see what it looks like, read the pie man page to
understand how to use it.

Whether you like it (or hate it), please let me know.
I would like to hear about bugs and improvements you would like to see.
I will correct the bugs quickly, especially if you send me a test script.

If you find a bug in the Tcl code and correct it yourself, please email the
modified code so I can include it in the next release. The same goes for
improvements.
